# unittest-framework-python

The unittest module is a built-in testing framework in Python that provides a set of tools for writing and running tests. It is part of the Python Standard Library and follows the xUnit style of testing.

With unittest, you can define test cases as classes and test methods as individual functions within those classes. The framework provides various assertion methods to check whether the expected behavior of your code matches the actual behavior during testing.
